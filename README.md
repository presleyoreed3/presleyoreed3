# Presley Reed III
### Full-Stack Software Engineer | Graphic Desinger | Photographer
#### (No I'm not named after Elvis)

I am a Full Stack software developer with strong skills in React / Redux, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, SQL, and MIPS Instruction Set. In addition to my wealth of programming languages, I am also well versed in both design tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator along with former experience as a graphic designer. 

With my background in layouts and graphic designing, I find I have a strong vision for UI / UX visuals as well as a robust knowledge of the inner workings of the backend data structures that support the frontend. 

Passions outside of programming include lots of gaming, Lego building, reading history(I was a history minor in college), and exploring the wonderful Forrests of the Pacific Northwest.
